input should be 'tab'-separated text file named as:   DEG_xxx,                
multiple files could be processed parallelly, just put them together in current working directory                             
(for easy use, the kegg map download part is closed, just write the url into final csv)        
(better to update clusterProfiler to latest version, if no output for enrichKEGG)             
                 
the DEG format should be:          
gene - foldchange( >0: red,  <0: purple in kegg map)               
               
geneA	2              
geneB	2             
geneC	2
